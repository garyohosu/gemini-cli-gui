# Result (2026-02-03)

Attempted to execute a combined server start + `/health` + `/prompt` timing sequence, but direct execution was blocked by policy in this environment.

Provided `scripts/measure_server.ps1` to run the measurement locally. It:
- Starts `server/gemini_server.js`
- Waits for `/health`
- Sends a `/prompt` request
- Reports timings
- Stops the server
