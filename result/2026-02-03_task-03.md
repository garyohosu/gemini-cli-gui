# Result (2026-02-03) — YOLO Expectation & Execution Order

## YOLO (-y) Expectation
- Current implementation in `server/gemini_server.js` forces `-y` (YOLO mode) on the `gemini` CLI subprocess.
- **Risk Identified**: If `gemini-cli` executes file operations directly due to `-y`, and the GUI then attempts to execute them again via `OperationExecutor` (after user approval), it may cause "File Already Exists" errors or redundant operations.
- **Recommendation**: Clarify if `gemini-cli` should be run without `-y` to allow the GUI to have exclusive control over execution, OR if `gemini-cli` has a mode to "output operations but do not execute".

## Execution Order & Next Steps
1. **Confirmed**: M0-4 WorkspaceSandbox verification is complete and tests pass.
2. **Pending**: Integration of Log Viewer back into the new redesign (as it was lost in the Sidebar/MainArea transition).
3. **Action**: The next major step is to refine the `operations` parsing to handle complex cases and binary files as per the spec.
