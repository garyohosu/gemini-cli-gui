# Result (2026-02-04) — Smoke Test Stabilization

## Changes
- Updated `scripts/smoke.vbs` to remove WMI-based PID lookup.
- Added title-based window wait (`WaitForWindow`) with explicit timeout (`APP_START_TIMEOUT_MS=10000`).
- Added step-by-step log lines and ensured `logFile.Close` on both success and failure paths.
- Switched default workspace input to current repository path via `CreateAbsolutePath(".")`.

## Validation
- Command: `cscript //nologo scripts\\smoke.vbs`
- Exit code: 0
- Output: `SendKeys smoke test finished.`
- Log tail confirms full sequence completed:
  - `Window detected`
  - `Activated by title`
  - `Open workspace chooser`
  - `Input workspace: C:\PROJECT\gemini-cli-gui-wt-test\.`
  - `Input prompt and submit`
  - `Finished`
