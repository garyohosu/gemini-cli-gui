# Result (2026-02-04) — SendKeys Smoke Test

## Command
`cscript //nologo scripts\smoke.vbs`

## Outcome
- Script reported an error:
  - `scripts\smoke.vbs(78, 3) (null): 0x80041021`
- Exit code: 0 (despite the error message)
- `logs/sendkeys.log` contains only the start marker:
  - `2026/02/04 12:55:29 Start`

## Notes
- The failure occurs in `FindAppPid` while executing the WMI query (`Win32_Process`).
- This environment may not support WMI queries for GUI processes or may be non-interactive.
