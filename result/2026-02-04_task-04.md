# Result (2026-02-04) — Basic Chat Roundtrip Verification

## What Was Verified
- Started `server/gemini_server.js` on a dedicated port (`9880`) with:
  - `GEMINI_WORKSPACE_ROOT=C:\PROJECT\gemini-cli-gui-wt-test`
  - `GEMINI_SERVER_PORT=9880`
- Called:
  1. `GET /health`
  2. `POST /prompt/start` with prompt `Say hello in one short sentence.`
  3. `GET /prompt/result?requestId=...` until completion

## Outcome
- Health: `ok`
- `coreAvailable`: `true`
- Prompt execution: `success=true`, `timedOut=false`, `exitCode=0`
- Elapsed: `102687ms`
- Response text returned:
  - `Hello! I'm ready to help you with your software engineering tasks.`

## Notes
- Basic server-side chat flow is functional (request accepted and response returned).
- Latency is high (~103s for this run), so responsiveness remains a practical issue.
